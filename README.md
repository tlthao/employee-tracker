Employee Tracker<br>

First you need to fork, then clone, the repository to your local, and make sure you're ready to use Node.js, and MySQL. After doing so, open the integrated terminal in the Employee_Tracker directory and in the command line enter "npm install" to install the necessary dependancies. For this app, you will need to create a .env in the app root directory. The contents of that file will simply be: DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password. This concludes the installation and you are ready to use the app. Below is an image of the npm install.
